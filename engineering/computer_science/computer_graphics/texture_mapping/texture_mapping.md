# Texture Mapping

### 1. Texture Mapping







### 1. Texture Mapping Optimization





##### # Mipmapping

Mipmapping construct [image pyramid]() and choose the closest size to do texture mapping to avoid over-resizing of texture image. This technique is supported by multiple graphics card.

Mipmapping reduce computation cost of texture mapping and anti-aliasing.



##### # Texture Caching

- Make the texture small.
- Group polygon 
- Tiling or Mosaicing technique: 



##### # Texture Compression

Fixed-rate texture compression.


Texture compression function is supported by D3D.






## 2. Multilayer Texture Mapping










## 3. Bump Mapping

Bump mapping simulate rough surface by modifying normal vectores of object surface.

Bump mapping is constructed by three texture mapping image:





## 4. Reflection Mapping
