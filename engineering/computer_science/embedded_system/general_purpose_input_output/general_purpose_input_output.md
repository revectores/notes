# General Purpose Input Output

**A general-purpose input/output (GPIO)** is an uncommitted digital signal pin on an integrated circuit or electronic circuit board which may be used as an input or output, or both, and is controllable by the user at runtime.

Note that the input and output register shared the same virtual address, but they are mapped to two different physical addresses.

Refer to [MSP432_GPIO]() for the practical details of GPIO in [MSP432]().
