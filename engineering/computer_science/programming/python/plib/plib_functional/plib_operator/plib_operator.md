# Python Library `operator`

The operator module exports a set of efficient functions corresponding to the intrinsic operators in Python. For example, `operator.add(x, y)` is equivalent to the expression `x+y`.

The function fall into categories that perform:

- Object comparison
- Logical operation
- Mathematical operation
- Sequence operation

Refer to [`operator` â€” Standard operators as functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html) for the full list of operator functions.
