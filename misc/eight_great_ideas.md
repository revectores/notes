1. Design for Moore's Law
2. Use Abstraction to Simplify Design
3. **Make the Common Case Fast**
4. Performance via Parallelism
5. Performance via Pipelining
6. Performance via Prediction
7. Hierarchy of Memories
8. Dependability via Redundancy



1. In order to design a successful operating system, the designers must have a clear idea of what they want.

2. Any designs should based on the physical reality.

3. Resolve "what" problems to "which" to reduce the mind burden. List the possible choice or the continuous spectrum for choice.

4. The principle is hard to directly applied to the reality, since each reality has its context, facing the specific context human usually doesn't remind himself about what principle to use. Anyway, humans lack of the ability of understanding the abstract concept. Only the **experience** from the application of such principle in the context makes it more and more usable.

    事实上某个抽象的原则是很难直接被人应用到实际中的，因为实际问题总是有着复杂而又多变的上下文，并不直接向人展示出应该怎样应用原则。人类缺乏理解和应用抽象概念的能力，只有具体的实践经历能够让人这一原则伴随着具体上下文更容易被提取。

5. Design goes first.
