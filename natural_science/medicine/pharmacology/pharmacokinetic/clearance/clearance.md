# Clearance

**Clearance** is a pharmacokinetic measurement of the volume of plasma from which a substance is completely removed per unit time, measured in L/h or mL/h. **Excretion**, on the other hand, is a measurement of the amount of a substance removed from the body per unit time, measured in mg/min or Î¼g/min.

Substance in the body can be cleared by various organs, including the kidneys, liver, lungs, etc. Thus total body clearance is equal to the sum clearance of the substance by each organ:

$$
\text{total body clearance = renal clearance + hepatic clearance + lung clearance}
$$

However for many substance clearance is solely a function of renal excretion. In these cases, clearance is almost asynonymous with renal clearance or renal plasma clearance.
