# Note Taking Pattern



### Cornell Notes System

The core idea of Cornell notes encourage to devide the notes into two parts: **recall column** writing keywords and questions on the left, and the **content column** on the right. This design aims to help reviewing: when reviewing the notes, one should cover the content column on the right, and try to recall the content based on keyword or answer questions on the recall column.

This note-making pattern emphasize the reviewing function of notes, and constructing mechanism to avoid the meaningless re-read, which has been proved to be extremely inefficienct learning method^[1]^.

> In our practice, the reviewing function has been taken over by the unittest system, while this approach still work if the notes-making process are executed on the paper.
