# Derivative

In finance, a **derivative** is a contract that derives its value from the performace of an underlying entity. The underlying entity can be an [asset](), [index](), or [interest rate](). Derivatives can be used for a number of purposes:

- Insure against price movements (hedging).
- Increase exposure to price movements for speculation.
- Get access to otherwise hard-to-trade assets or markets.

Some of the more common derivatives include [forwards](), [futures](), [options](), [swaps](), and variations of these.
