# Linux Command `ls`

`-a`. Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot `.`

`-A`. List all entries except `.` and `..`. This is always set for the super-user.

The difference: `-a` option will list all files, while `-A` will ignore the `.`/`..`

`-d`. List the information of directory itself instead of list all contents.
