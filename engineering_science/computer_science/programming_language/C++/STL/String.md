# String

##### # Using String as A Container

Now welcome to the future. The modern C++ provides a human way of manipulating string. We considered string as a container, as a data type just as `int`.

- Now we can construct string, and assigned it again and again.

- We can get the length of string by member function `size()` as all the containers do.

- We can use `<` operator to do the comparsion with the same function of `strcmp`.
- We can use `+` operator to do the concatenation.
- We can use member function  `find` to find the occurance of substring.
