# Flip-Flop Review

### 1. Core Concepts

##### # Definition

1. Differentiate flip-flop from normal logic gates. +3

   

##### # Represetation

1. Explain the three table representation of flip-flop: Truth Table, State Table and Activative Table using SR Flip-Flop as the demo, as well as the conversion among different representation. +10

2. Explain how to generate the logic expression based on the table expression. +3

   

##### # Classification

1. Classify flip-flop based on the logic effect (that is, the logic expression, regardless of the specific structure and other features). Write down the logic expression and activation table of the four important types of flip-flop. +15
2. Classify flip-flop based on the reaction to clock pulse, and explain the differences. +15



##### # Conversion

1. Illustrate how to convert one type (logic-effect-based classification) of flip-flop into another. Generate the conversions among SR, JK, D, and T flip-flop. +15







### 2. Classification of Structures

##### # SR Locker

1. Draw the structure of SR Locker without Clock Pulse, and explain why this structure works. +10
2. Add the Clock Pulse into your SR Locker drawn before. +5



##### # Locker

1. Restruct the SR Locker with CP into D Locker and JK Locker. +7
2. Why do we consider the JK Locker restructed by the SR Locker unusable? +10



##### # Master-Slave Flip-Flop

1. Construct the Master-Slave SR Flip-Flop and explain how it works. +10
2. What's the weakness of master-slave flip-flop? +5
3. ~~Problem 4.4 and 4.5 in the [TextBook](). +5



##### # Edge-Triggered Flip-Flop

1. **Construct the edge-triggered SR flip-flop. +15
2. **Restrcut the edge-triggered SR flip-flip into D flip-flop. +10
