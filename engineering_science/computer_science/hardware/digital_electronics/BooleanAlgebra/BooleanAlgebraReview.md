# Boolean Algebra Review

### Logic Function

1. What is two-value logic?

2. What is logic/switching funtion? Define the equality and reverse relationship of logic function.

3. Describe five ways of representing a logic function. How to convert logic expression between other four?

4. Give the basic logic operator and their truth table.

    > Give the pros&cons to express logic operator as common $+$ and $\times$.
    >
    > Assume that there is 30% possibility occuring input `1` and 70% for input `0`, calculate the expectation for the function value.

5. Give the composite logic operator. How are those composite logic operator constructed by the basic logic operator? Prove the relationship between `XOR` and `XAND`. ==Find out the naming reason of `XOR` and `XAND`==

6. Give the graph expression in GB4728.12-85 and ISO of the operator mentioned in (4)(5). What is the pros&cons of GB? ==Find out the standard index of ISO, and find out more pros and cons for GB/ISO.==



### Properties of Logic Operator and Logic Function

1. Give the correspondent property based on each point's description. Using natural language to explain what's the meaning of them.

    > Besides the describe the meaning, provide the application in computer science if possible.

    - Find out the element of **Identity** and **Annihilators** for operator `AND` and `OR` in ring `{0,1}`. 
    - Explain the **Idempotence** of operator `AND` and `OR`.
    - Explain the **Complementation Law**.
    - Explain the **Double Negation Law**.
    - Give the Associativity, Commutativity, and Distributivity of `AND` and `OR`.

2. Explain and prove **De Morgan's** Law based on the basic laws above. What makes De Morgan's Law so important?

3. Using `NAND` and `NOR` to construct three basic logic `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` based on the properties of logic operator.

4.
