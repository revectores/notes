# Flip-Flop

### 1. Core Concepts

##### # Definition



##### # Represetation



##### # Classification

The symbol notification: we'll call the RS flip-flop as SR flip-flop, since in the name of JK flip-flop J responses for "set" and K responses for "reset", if the order keeps as RS, it's quite easy to "compare" R to J and S to K, which is not right. (besides, the reason why we don't swap JK is that we prefer the "set" function in the front.)
