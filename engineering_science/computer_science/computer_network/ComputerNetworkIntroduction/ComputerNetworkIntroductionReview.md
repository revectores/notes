# Computer Network Introduction Review

1. Explain the following concepts

	- IMP

	- ISP/ICP

	- DLC

	- Service Primitives

	- Communication Subnet & Resource Subnet

	- [**Transparency**][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_transparency]

2. **Clarify what does "layer" mean, and try to introduce how the communication procedure between two computers works to a new computer network learner.**

3. **What is the difference in the core design thinking between traditional phone network and modern Internet, explain why the later one was constructed differently.**

4. What is OSI/RM seven-level protocols and why it's important, explain the basic structure of OSI model.

5. What is TCP/IP five-level model, compare it with OSI/RM, and explain why it is widely used instead.

6. Draw the frequently used structures of network and clarify which kind of network is most usually applied for each of them(LAN or WAN). 

7. Open any network simulator you like and feel free to drag some network devices to build a remarkable network (more complexities, more fun!). After finishing your architectures, try to explain:
	
	What kind of structure do you build? If there seems not any structures included, divide it into many pieces of network and try to find out whether each of them is (if not again, do it recursively). If it's not anyway, please add some hardwares to build a more exciting network.
	
	Where should the Communication Subnet & Resource Subnet & IMP & ISP & ICP be located in your network?

	P.S. You can accomplish this project by using NetSim/ENSP or any network simulator you like!

[^2]: Layer is one of the core abstract concepts in network structure, actually it's easy to comprehend this concept if one has already known about **encapsulation** in object-oriented tech or any idea about **API** in software engineering. Besides, it's significant to get an overview for one who just started to learn computer network, otherwise it's extremely easy to lose the direction during the following learning in each layer of the network (where am I, and which layer are you taking about?), so one must have the ability to introduce to someone else about it to make sure one getting true understanding.
[^3]: Why computer network is exciting, differs from any other kinds of network? Obviously the idea of package transfer makes everything different, and for the most important part, it makes a network can be designed **decentralized**. Why it's vital? Maybe Bitcoin can give a proper answer (or not?).
