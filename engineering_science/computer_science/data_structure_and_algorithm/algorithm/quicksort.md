# Quicksort

The core idea of quicksort is divide-and-conquer, three steps included in quicksort:

1. Choose one element `pivot`.
2. Partitioning. Place those elements larger than `pivot` on the right and those less than `pivot` on the left, the `pivot` has been placed in the right location now.
3. Do it recursively to the left and right subsequcne until the length reaches 0 or 1.

Here's the implementation on C.
