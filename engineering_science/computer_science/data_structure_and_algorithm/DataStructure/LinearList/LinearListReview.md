# Linear List Review

### 1. Introduction

##### # Basic Concepts

1. Define Linear List.
2. Explain the what node/record, field/domain means in the linear list, Give examples to demonstrate these concepts in the practice.
3. Can `array` or `vector` in C and `list` in Python be considered as a linear list?

##### # Operations

1. Classify the basic operation on linear list.

##### # Classification

1. Classify the storage stragery of linear list.



### 2. Array

##### # Implementation

1. Implement an array in C.
2. Express the address of $a_i$ by the zero-index element $a_0$ and index $i$.

##### # Operations

1. Design an algorithm to insert an element into array. Take care of the edge cases.
2. Design an algorithm to delete an element into array. Take care of the edge cases.
3. Calculate the average time complexity of insertion/deletion operation. Assume that the possiblity distribution of insert index is uniform. What kind of possiblity distribution will deduce the average time complexity and what will increase it?
4. Design an algorithm to represent polynomial by array. implement an function to add two polynomial by your data structure.
