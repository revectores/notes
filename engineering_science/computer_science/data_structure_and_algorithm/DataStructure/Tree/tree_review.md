# Tree

### 1. Tree Data Structure

##### # Basic Concepts

1. Give the definition of tree.

2. What is the degree of a tree? What is forest?

3. Give at least three objects which can be expressed by tree structure.



##### # Representation of Tree

1. Describe the three methods of tree representation, and use C code to implement your model.

2. Describe how to find out how many children a node has in the standard form or extended standard form of tree.



##### # Linear Storage of Tree

1. How to store the tree in a linear form?

2. Contruct an algorithm to convert the linear form into the standard form.







### 2. Iteration Algorithm

##### # Classfication

1. Classify the iteration methods of tree.



##### # Pre-order and Post-Order Traversal

1. Implement the preorder and postorder traversal by recursion.

2. Implement the preorder traversal by stack.



##### # Level-Order Traversal

1. Implement level-order traversal.
