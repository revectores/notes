# ARM Instruction

##### ARM Instruction Format

The basic format of ARM instruction is

```assembly
<opcode> (<cond>) (S) <Rd> <Rn>, (<Op2>)
```

Explanations of fields:

1. `<opcode>` is the operation code (or mnemonic symbol).
2. `<cond>` is the condition field, the instruction will only be executed if the condition is true.





Eight addressing approaches are supported in ARM
