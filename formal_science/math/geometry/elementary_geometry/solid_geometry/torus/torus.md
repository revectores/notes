# Torus

##### # Definition

A **toroid** is a surface of revolution generated by revolving a two-dimensional shape in three-dimensional space about an axis that is coplanar with the shape. The two most common shapes are rectangle (without assigned specialized name, used in transformer, refer to [Toroidal_inductors_and_transformers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toroidal_inductors_and_transformers)) and circle, named **torus**.



##### # Equation

A torus can be defined parametrically by
$$
\begin{align}
& x(\theta, \varphi) = (R + r\cos\theta)\cos\varphi \\
& y(\theta, \varphi) = (R + r\cos\theta)\sin\varphi \\
& z(\theta, \varphi) = r\sin\theta
\end{align}
$$
where $R$ is the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus. $r$ is the radius of the tube.

In Cartesian coordinates:
$$
\left(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - R\right)^2 + z^2 = r^2
$$



##### # Classification

Based on the relative location between axis of revolution and the circle, or formally, relation between $R, r$ in equation, there are three types of torus:

- If $R > r$, that is, the axis of revolution does not touch the circle, the surface has a ring shape, and is called a **ring torus**.
- If $R = r$, that is, the axis of revolution is tangent to the circle, the surface is a **horn torus**.
- If $R < r$, that is, the axis of revolution is secant line to the circle, the surface is a **spindle torus**.
