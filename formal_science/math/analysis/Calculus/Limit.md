# Limit

### 1. Definition

1. Define the limit of progression and function using the language of $\delta-\varepsilon$. +3



### 2. Properties

1. Describe the idea to prove the uniqueness, boundedness, 保号性, 保不等式性, Squeeze Theorem. +20

2. Prove the two important limit:

$$
\lim_{x\to0}\cfrac{\sin x}x = 1
$$

$$
\lim_{x\to+\infin}\left(1+\frac{1}{x}\right)^x = \mathrm{e}
$$

Notes: You're allowed to just prove the progression form of the second important limit, but you should specify the insight about why we can generalize this into the function form.



### 3.  Infinitesimal and Infinity

1. Define the infinitesimal and infinity. +5

2. Define the order of infinitesimal. +5

3. Write down the polynomial function which is equivlance to the following infinitesimal: +5
   $$
   \sin x, \quad \cos x, \quad \tan x, \quad
   \arcsin x, \quad \arctan x
   $$

4. Prove the arithmetic (four operations) on limit are valid. You're allowed to use the infinitesimal tool. +10

5. Point out What you should be notice when you split one limit expression into two or more. +2

6. Define the continuity and the point of discontinuity of function. +10

7. Classify the discontinuity.

8. Prove the L'Hospital's Rule, and notice the usage condition.
