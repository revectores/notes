# Absolute Value Inequality

### 1. Fundamental Property

The definition of absolute value inferred the fundamental properties:


$$
\begin{align}
\abs a \le b ~~~~ \Leftrightarrow ~~~~ & -b \le a \le b \\
\abs a \ge b > 0 ~~~~ \Leftrightarrow ~~~~ & a > b ~~ \text{or} ~~ a < -b 
\end{align}
$$







### 2. Triangle Inequality

##### # Modulus Form

Triangle inequality of complex numbers can be inferred from the physical interpretation of modulus of complex number in complex plane:
$$
|z_1 + z_2| \le |z_1| + |z_2|
$$
where $z_1, z_2$ are complex numbers. Specially, for the real numbers in real axis, we have
$$
|a + b| \le |a| + |b|
$$
When the two variables are both real numbers, there are only two different cases:
$$
\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
|a+b| = |a|+|b|, ~~~~ab\ge 0 \\
|a+b| = ||a|-|b|| < ||a| + |b|| = |a| + |b|, ~~~~ ab<0&
\end{array}\right.
$$
This might be the most important inequality of absolute value, which leads us to many significant results.
