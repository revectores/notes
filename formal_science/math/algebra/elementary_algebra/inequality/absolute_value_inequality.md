# Absolute Value Inequality

### Basic Property

The definition of absolute value inferred the basic following properties:


$$
\begin{align}
\abs a \le b ~~~~ \Leftrightarrow ~~~~ & -b \le a \le b \\
\abs a \ge b > 0 ~~~~ \Leftrightarrow ~~~~ & a > b ~~ \text{or} ~~ a < -b 
\end{align}
$$






### Triangle Inequality

##### # Basic Form

The physical meaning of the triangle is clear: the distance from A to B plus the distance from B to C will always not less than the distance from B to C, which is $|AB| + |BC| > |AC|$ in geometry.

Since the modulus of complex number represents the length in the complex plain, the modulus obeys triangle inequality:

$$
\abs{a+b} \le \abs{a} + \abs{b}
$$

where $a, b$ are complex number. It also works when $a, b$ are both real number.

When the two variables are both real numbers, there are only two different cases:

- If $a, b$ share the same sign, or one of them is zero, it turns to equality, $\abs{a+b} = \abs{a} + \abs{b}$.
- If $a, b$ have different signs, it turns out that $\abs{a+b} < \abs{a} + \abs{b}$.

This might be the most important inequality of absolute value, who could leads us to many other inferences.
