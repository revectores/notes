# Ellipse

##### Definition

Ellipse is the plane curve that contains all the points that the sum of distance from two **focal points** all the same. That is, for two focal points $F_{1}, F_{2}$, $F_{1}P + F_{2}P = d > 0$. Usually we denoted the sum of distance $d=2a$, and the distance between two focal, called **focal distance** or **linear eccentricity**, as $2c$.

The equation of standard ellipse, which centered at the origin(that is, the two focal points are put at $x$ axis symmetrically), computed as

$$
\sqrt{(x+c)^2 + y^2} + \sqrt{(x-c)^2 + y^2} = 2a
$$

That is,

$$
\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1
$$

where we define $b^2 = a^2 - c^2$.



The length of chord that generates from standard form equation of ellipse and line can be expressed as:

$$
d = \frac{2\sqrt{a^2b^2(A^2+B^2)(a^2A^2+b^2B^2+C^2)}}{a^2A^2+b^2B^2}
$$
