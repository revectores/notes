# Ordinary Differential Equation

#### Basic Concept

**Ordinary Differential Equations**(ODE): have only one independent and one dependent variable.

**$k$-Order Equation**: the highest derivative is $k$.

**Separation OF Variables**: separate the $x$ with $\mathrm dx$, and $y$ with $\mathrm dy$ to the different side, then integral two sides.

**Lost Solution**: similar to the lost root in the fractional equation, some root can be hidden since there is fraction process existed in the separation process, generally, equation such like
$$
\begin{align}
\cfrac{dy}{dx} &= 2y + 1 \\
\cfrac{dy}{2y+1} &= 1 dx \\
\ln|2y+1| + C &= 2x \text{d}x \\
2y+1 &= e^{2x} \\
\end{align}
$$
**Isocline**: a line that connect the same slop at the deritative field.
