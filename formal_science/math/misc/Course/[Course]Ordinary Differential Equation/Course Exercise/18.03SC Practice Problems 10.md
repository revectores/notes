##### 1.

The characteristic polynomial is
$$
r^2 + \w^2=0
$$
and its roots are $\pm i\w $. So the roots of original ODE are real/imaginary parts of $e^{\pm i\wt}$, As to $e^{i\wt}$, the real part is $\cos \wt$ and the imaginary part is $\sin \wt$, and as to $e^{-i\wt}$ the real part is $\cos(-\wt) = \cos\wt$, the imaginary part is $\sin(-\wt) =-\sin\wt$, but to find out all the general solutions we only need one of them.

Check:
$$
(\cos \wt)'' + \w^2\cos\wt = -\w^2\cos \wt + \w^2\cos\wt
$$
Simiarly the other solution are also solutions to the orginal equation.

The general real solution can be expressed by the linear combination of the linear lndependent solutions:
$$
y = C_1\cos\wt + C_2\sin\wt
$$


##### 2.

(a) The solution is generated by a imagary solution of characterisitc equation, which means that there must be a relationship among the coefficient that
$$
b^2 < 4km
$$
(b) As we know $e^{-t/2}\cos{3t}$ must be the imaginary part of the exponential solution, so the original solution should be written as
$$
e^{-t/2}\cos3t = e^{-t/2}e^{3ti} = e^{(3i-1/2)t}
$$
