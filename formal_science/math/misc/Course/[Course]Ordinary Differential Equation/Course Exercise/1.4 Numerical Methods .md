# 1.4 Numberical Methods

##### 1.

At each point the best approximate is the stepsize $h=0.125$, and the result is too low compared with the actual solution. As the stepsize is approach to 0, the approximate is more accurate than before.

Check is the y'' rule is correct: the second derivative
$$
y'' = 0.5 > 0
$$
is always positive, as a result it's always a convex function. According to the previous result, a convex function makes the Euler Method too low, so this statement passes the test.

##### 2.

I can for this instance. All of the approximation is going to be too high.

##### 3.

When the stepsize is too large, the earlier error makes the graph be too high where the derivitive is much too large, as a results they cannot get the information about "turn down", so those graphes are incorrectly approaching infinity.
