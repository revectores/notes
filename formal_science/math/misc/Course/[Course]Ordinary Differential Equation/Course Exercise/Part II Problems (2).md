### Part II Problems (2)

##### Problem 1

(a) The ODE is
$$
0.5x'' + 1.5x' + 0.625x = 0
$$
Its corresponding characteristic is
$$
0.5r^2 + 1.5r + 0.625 = 0
$$

$$
4r^2 + 12r + 5 = 0
$$

The root of this equation is
$$
r_1 = -\cfrac{1}{2}, r_2 = -\cfrac{5}{2}
$$
Which exactly gives the same thing as what the graph shows.

(b) Based on the result of (a), the general solution of original ODE is
$$
y = C_1e^{-\frac{1}{2}t} + C_2e^{-\frac{5}{2}t}
$$
With initial condition $x(0) = x_0, \dot x = \dot x_0â€‹$ appiled,
$$
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
& C_1 + C_2 = x_0 \\
& -0.5C_1 + -2.5C_2 = \dot x_0
\end{aligned}
\right.
$$
Solve this, we got
$$
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
& C_1 = \cfrac{5}{4}x_0 + \cfrac{1}{2}\dot x_0 \\
& C_2 = -\cfrac{1}{4}x_0 - \cfrac{1}{2}\dot x_0
\end{aligned}
\right.
$$
