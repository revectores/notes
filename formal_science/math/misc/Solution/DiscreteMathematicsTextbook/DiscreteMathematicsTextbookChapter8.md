##### # Exercise 29.

This is quite obvious: if the cut edge is not contained in the spanning tree, the spanning tree must be not connected, which is not a tree. 




##### # Exercise 33.

No. It can also be the combination of rooted tree and a circle graph. That's why the tree is defined as "A **tree** that only 1 vertex has degree 0 and the others have 1."



##### # Exercise 37.

Consider of a process from the root to generating a full m-order tree, at the beginning, the root got 1 leave(itself) and no split vertex, if one of the vertex turns from the leave into the split vertex, m more children appended, and the vertex itself will no longer be them-1 leaves, so in total, one more vertex, $(m-1)$ more leaves, formally

$$
\cfrac{\Delta{n_{0}}}{\Delta{n'}} = m-1
$$
